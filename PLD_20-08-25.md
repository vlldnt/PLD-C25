| **2. Explain the difference between `justify-content` and `align-items`.** | First aligns elements on the main axis (depending on the flex-direction)<br>Align-items aligns items along the cross axis |
| **3. What does the `flex-wrap` property do, and when would you use it?** | With display: flex, it forces elements to go from one line to multiple lines for responsiveness if elements are minimum size<br>nowrap / wrap / wrap-reverse |
| **4. How does the `align-self` property work, and which elements does it affect?** | It allows you to select one flex item to override the alignment |
| **5. What is the purpose of the order property in Flexbox?** | Controls the visual order of the flex items in the flex container |
| **6. Explain the flex shorthand property and what each of its components represents.** | The flex shorthand sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space. It's often defined as `flex: <grow> <shrink> <basis>;`.  <br>- `flex-grow`: Defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary.  <br>- `flex-shrink`: Defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.  <br>- `flex-basis`: Defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. |
| **7. What does the `align-content` property do, and when is it useful?** | It aligns a flex container's lines within the container when there is extra space on the **cross axis**. It only has effect when there are **multiple lines** of flex items |
| **8. How can you center an element both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox?** | display: flex, justify-content: center, align-items: center |
